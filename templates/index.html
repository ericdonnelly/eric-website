            with topics in software and engineering is a unique challenge. As a junior developer and storyteller, I am passionate about technical projects that drive insight and innovation to both businesses and people. Software companies need a reliable team member that communicates development concepts effectively to clients, stakeholders, and collaborators. I am motivated to deliver precision and simplicity to topics in data science and machine learning to further interest and investment in the field.

            First, the bricklaying
          </h3>
          <p>
            Let’s say you’re in the masonry business. To target sales for home repairs, you may need to determine brick homes from non-brick homes. In the context of machine learning, categorization is a classification problem. To make predictions on unseen data, a training dataset must be designed. A training dataset is pre-classified through a manual or semi-automated process.
          </p>
          <p>
            We retrieved image data primarily from a python script that interfaced with the Google Streetview API. By collecting data through Google Streetview, we were able to design a model specific to the Evanston, Illinois area and link our data directly to geocoded information. To ensure our model had more distinct versions of brick and non-brick homes, additional data was scraped from Google Images. All collected images were sorted between brick, siding, and unknown.
